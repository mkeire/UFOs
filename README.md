# UFOs

## Summary

The technologies used in the UFOs project are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project's purpose was to create a functional web page that allows the user to filter UFO events.

This tongue-in-cheek project introduces fictional UFO sightings data from January 1, 2010, to January 13, 2010, with data such as duration and comments. Users can filter these sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape.

Greater functionality could be added to the website if the sightings could be filtered by duration and comments. A form would allow the user to report their own UFO experiences.
